### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, a little about me...

Hi! I'm Robert Young, also known by my pseudonym PixelsPencil. I like to design and build websites with HTML/CSS/Sass and a sprinkle of JS here and there.

I see myself more of a front end web designer than a developer, I have been working in the web industry for nearly 20 years mostly on the visual/design side of things.

I live in London, UK, like to travel, love cycling, walking, and going to concerts and listening to music.

- ðŸ›  My website: <https://www.pixelspencil.com>
  - is very much a work in progress, built using Eleventy and mostly based but adapted from the build in the amazing [Learn Eleventy from Scratch](https://piccalil.li/course/learn-eleventy-from-scratch) course by [Andy Bell](https://github.com/hankchizljaw). 

- ðŸ”­ Currently working on design and build for personal and example websites to demo what I can design and build.
- ðŸŒ± Currently learning various things to top up or compliment what I already know
  - CSS/HTML/SVG
  - Sass/Gulp
  - Learn more about JavaScript as I am pretty weak with it but very much a work in progress
  - Design applications such as Figma and Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop
  - Considering learning Animate and After Effects
  - 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I create lots of art/craft stuff in my spare time, which can be seen on my instagram accounts [PixelsPencil][pixelspencilIG] and [sketchinabottle][siabIG]
