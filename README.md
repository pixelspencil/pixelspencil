Hi! I'm Robert Young, also known by my pseudonym PixelsPencil. I like to design and build websites with HTML/CSS/Sass and a sprinkle of JS here and there.

I see myself more of a front end web designer than a developerand I have been working in the web industry for nearly 20 years mostly on the visual/design side of the web.

I live in London, UK, like to travel, love cycling, walking, and going to concerts and listening to music.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on designs for a few personal and example websites to demo what I can design and build.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning CSS/HTML/SVG from the ground up along with design applications such as Figma and Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m also trying to learn more about JavaScript as I am pretty weak but very much a work in progress.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I create lots of art/craft stuff in my spare time, which can be seen on my instagram accounts [PixelsPencil][pixelspencilIG] and [sketchinabottle][siabIG]
